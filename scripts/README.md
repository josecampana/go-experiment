# /scripts

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple (e.g., <https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/Makefile>).

See the [/scripts](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/blob/master/scripts/README.md) directory for examples.
